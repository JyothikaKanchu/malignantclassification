# malignantclassification
malignant breast cancer types are often divided into subcategories based on the origin and behavior of the tumor cells. The classifications like DC, LC, MC, and PC typically stand for different histological types of malignant breast tumors:
DC – Ductal Carcinoma
Description: Cancer that begins in the milk ducts (the tubes that carry milk to the nipple).

Most Common Type: Includes Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), which accounts for about 70–80% of all breast cancers.

Subtype: Also includes DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ), which is non-invasive or pre-invasive cancer.

Features: Grows through the duct wall and may spread to other parts.

LC – Lobular Carcinoma
Description: Begins in the lobules, the glands that produce milk.

Subtype: Includes Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC) and Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS).

Second Most Common Type: Represents about 10–15% of invasive breast cancers.

Features: Harder to detect via mammogram and may appear in both breasts.

 MC – Mucinous Carcinoma
Description: A rare type of invasive ductal carcinoma in which the cancer cells are surrounded by mucin.

Rarity: Accounts for about 2–3% of breast cancers.

Features: Often has a better prognosis than other types due to slower growth.

PC – Papillary Carcinoma
Description: A rare type of breast cancer characterized by finger-like projections (papillae) under the microscope.

Subtype: Can be invasive or non-invasive (often Papillary DCIS).

Rarity: Accounts for less than 1–2% of breast cancers.

Features: Usually occurs in older women and tends to grow slowly.
